## Trading Rules / Parameters
The trading rule combines all indicators, only when all expressiÃµes are satisfied, the strategy will be executed.

### Leverage
Leverage amplifies gains and loses in a multiplicative way. this value can be configured from 1 to 60.

### MACD
Configurable parameters: fast ema period, slow ema period and signal ema period ( the range of values are from 2 to 200)
Expression: the signal is active when the signal line value is above X for long position and below X for short position.

### RSI
Configurable parameters: period used and [I,J] values that define a range that must contain the rsi value.
Expression: the signal is active when the rsi value is between I and J.

### EWMA
Configurable parameters: period used, percentage difference (PD1) from 0.1% to 100%
Expression: the signal is active when the percentage difference from the ewma is greater than the PD1 defined.

## SMA
Configurable parameters: period used, maximum percentage difference (PD2) from EWMA to activate the signal.
Expression: the signal is active when the percentage difference betwen the SMA and the EWMA is lower than PD2.
